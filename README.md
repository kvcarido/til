# TIL

> Today I learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things we learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. In my attempts to build a second brain and overall commitment to [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), these short-form notes are the bits of information that don't warranty a full blog write-up yet still handy to reference.s

> ðŸŒŸ The original format and inspiration behind this style of note-taking is from [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)

### ðŸš§ Road Map
- [ ] Research potential automation when posting, (use `git-hooks`?)
- [ ] Write Hashnode blog about inspiration + differences
- [ ] Figure out a name for these posts / entries / tidbits?
