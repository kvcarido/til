# TIL

> Today I learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things we learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. In my attempts to build a second brain and overall commitment to [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), these short-form notes are the bits of information that don't warranty a full blog write-up yet still handy to reference.s

ðŸŒŸ The original format and inspiration behind this style of note-taking is from [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)

_0 TIL and counting..._
